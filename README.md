This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the simulation and data results in Sections 5 and 6 of "Efficient estimation and data fusion under general semiparametric restrictions on outcome mean functions"

There are a total of two .Rmd files giving the main code for the simulations and data example.

The chunks running the simulations can be uncommented to re-run the simulations, though for convenience the RDS output of those sims has also been provided.

The .csv files used in the data examples are also included for reference.
