This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the simulation and data results in Sections 5 and 6 of "Efficient estimation and data fusion under general semiparametric restrictions on outcome mean functions"

There are a total of two .Rmd files --- outcome_bias_sim.Rmd and tennessee_star.Rmd --- giving the main code for the simulations and data example, respectively. The code chunks actually running the simulations have been commented out, with the outputs saved in .RDS files (``or_sims_cont``, ``or_sims_disc``, and ``tennessee_star``).

The .csv files used in the data examples are also included for reference.
