This file contains the code needed to reproduce the simulation and data results in Section 4 of "Efficient combination of observational and experimental datasets under structural assumptions on outcome mean functions."

There are a total of four .Rmd files giving the main code for the two simulation settings and the two data examples.

The chunks running the simulations can be uncommented to re-run the simulations, though for convenience (the simulations take several hours to run) the output of those sims has also been provided.

The .csv files used in the data examples are also included for reference.

Please contact Harrison at hli90722 "at" stanford "dot" edu with any questions or concerns.
